### Features:
- Database Done by OOP Classes and interfaces
- Complete isolation between the three layers. The front-end layer is treated only with the back-end layer, which acts as an intermediary between it and the database.
- The ability to verify the email by sending it a confirmation code
- If the password is forgotten, it can be retrieved via the Forgot Password button, which receives the email and sends a confirmation message to it.
- The user has several advantages, such as searching for the product in several ways
- When purchasing a product, it is first placed in the cart in which what the user has chosen is collected, and he can view this card to modify what he has chosen.
- A simple analysis of what the user did by purchasing products on this website
- There is a complete analysis of the products added by the admin, as announced in the image above, and an illustrative graph of the most purchased products.
